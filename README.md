# 30 Days of Rust

Try to learn Rust in 30 days.

## How does it work?

Every day for 30 days:

1. Read documentation for your day
1. Submit solution to a task in your day `./tasks/day-X` as PR
1. Ask for code review from peers in the PR by tagging your mentors
1. Spend maximum of 60 minutes per day doing this (use stopwatch)
1. Every week solve one more complicated task uploaded in `./weekly-tasks/`
1. At the end of 30 days solve the final task uploaded in `./final-boss/`

## Submit solutions

You can submit your solutions as PR in `solutions/{username}`.
