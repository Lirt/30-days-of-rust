# Day 001

Sum of numbers

Topics: [variables, tuples, arrays, slices, mutability, for loops, operators and symbols]

## Learning

We will partially use rustlings course for education. In your first day clone the [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) repository and make it work.

Read following documentation:
- [Variables and mutability](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html)
- [Rust by example - Chapter 2 of primitives](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/primitives.html)
- [Accepting command line arguments](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-01-accepting-command-line-arguments.html#reading-the-argument-values)
- [For and range loop](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/flow_control/for.html)
- [Operators and symbols](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-02-operators.html)

Finish 6 rustlings [variables exercises](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/tree/main/exercises/variables) where you usually need to correct the code to make it run properly.

## Task / Challenge

Write a simple command line program, that will accept list of arguments - numbers - separated by whitespace ` `. Calculate the sum of the numbers and print it to STDOUT.

Submit your solution to `./tasks/{YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}/day-{X}` and open a PR. Make sure to tag your mentors for a code review.
